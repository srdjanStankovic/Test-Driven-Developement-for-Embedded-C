# Test-Driven-Developement-for-Embedded-C
This repository consists source code from book ["Test-Driven Development for Embedded C"](https://www.bookdepository.com/Test-Driven-Development-C-James-W-Grenning/9781934356623?ref=grid-view&qid=1584205340552&sr=1-1) by [James W. Grenning](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jwgrenning/).

This repo is used as source code storage while I'm reading this book. As I progress with the book I am updating repo.
Repo with the same content can be found at Mr.Grenning GitHub and its called [tddec-code](https://github.com/jwgrenning/tddec-code).
